 # 🔸D30printerPWA. Install the app without compiler or other hassle🔸
 This is a boilerplate for deploying Phomemo D30 printer webapp using Github Pages.   
 #### How to use?
Visit the actual printer app page below and click on install button in browser address window. On an Android device, press "Add to home screen". This will install Printer as PWA app on your desktop, which you can then use offline like any regular app.  
For this to work, your browser must be Chromium-based (unfortunately, Firefox is not compatible). It is also likely that you will need to enable Bluetooth compatibility in your browser. 
(for example in brave use brave://flags tab for that) 

# [D30printerPWA](http://catdogmaus.github.io/D30printerPWA/)

#### What could go wrong?
Dont tell me about errors, there are lots of little ones, I need some time to iron them out.  
Bluetooth permissions. It is tested only in my device. 
I tried to make the app as universal as possible. Unfortunately, different versions of Phomemo devices use different protocols to connect to the printer. In settings you can try to switch between Phomemo and legacy methods. I don't have any way to test devices other than mine, so if it doesn't work for you, you're out of luck.  
If anyone discovers that this app works with a model other than the D30, it would be great if you could let us know here so I can pass this information on to others.   
If you are happy with the app and it was useful to you, then maybe it won't take much to use the support button above.
