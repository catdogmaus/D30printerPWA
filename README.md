 # 🔸D30printerPWA. Install it here without any compiler or other unnecessary hassles. You should try other printer models too!🔸
 This is a boilerplate for deploying Phomemo D30 printer webapp using Github Pages.   
 #### How to use?
Visit the actual printer app page below and click on install button in browser address window. On an Android device, press "Add to home screen". This will install Printer as PWA app on your desktop, which you can then use offline like any regular app.  
On iOS open the PWA website in Safari, tap the "Share" icon at the bottom of the screen, select "Add to Home Screen," and then tap "Add" to complete the installation.

For this to work, your browser must be Chromium-based (unfortunately, Firefox is not compatible). It is also likely that you will need to enable Bluetooth compatibility in your browser.  
(for example in brave use ```brave://flags``` tab for that or in chrome ```crome://flags```)  

App says D30 printer, but in settings are options for other print protocols. When you have another model you should just try it out!

For you mobile device to open page use

#### What could go wrong?
Bluetooth permissions. It is tested only in my device. 
I tried to make the app as universal as possible, so there is chance that it would work with other printers. Just change label size accordingly. Different versions of Phomemo devices use different protocols to connect to the printer. In settings you can try to switch between Phomemo and legacy methods. I don't have any way to test devices other than mine, so if it doesn't work for you, you're out of luck.  
If anyone discovers that this app works with a model other than the D30, it would be great if you could let us know here so I can pass this information on to others.   
If you are happy with the app and it was useful to you, then maybe it won't take much to use the support button above.
